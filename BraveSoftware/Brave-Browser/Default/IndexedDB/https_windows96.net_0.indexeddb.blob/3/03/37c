## Windows 96 Beta Statement

### âš  Windows 96 is a beta website.

This means that not all features may work as intended. You will very likely find bugs and glitches which could break the experience.

We are working very hard to find and fix bugs/glitches, trust me.

### ðŸ›  How to fix problems

You will probably encounter problems at some point using this site. Here are the most common ways to fix them.

#### The easiest fix

The easiest way to fix most bugs and glitches is to reload the page.

This can be done using `CTRL+R` or `F5`.

#### Other methods

**Try resetting your installation** - This can help fix issues with recent WINDOWS96 releases. To do this, go to start and select `Reinstall`.

**Try clearing the cache** - Clear the cache to ensure all latest content is downloaded.

**Try recovery mode** - Hold ALT+I on boot to enter recovery mode. From here, you may be able to remove problematic files.

**Report the bug** - Though this may sound stupid, reporting the bug will make us fix it, *eventually*.
To do this, open `Report Bug` from the desktop.
