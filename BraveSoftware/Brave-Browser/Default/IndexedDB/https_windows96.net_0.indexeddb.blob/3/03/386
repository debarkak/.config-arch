# Welcome to Windows 96!

Windows 96 is a Win9x-esque Web OS loaded with a bunch of programs and other fun stuff for you to use.

Any files you upload on the Windows 96 environment will NOT be uploaded to the cloud, everything is client side (unless you use our online services such as MsgRoom).

```
âš  Be wary of users trying to get you to open random JS files, such files can be malicious and you may lose your data within Windows 96.
